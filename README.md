## todo
- maybe center however something like Goyo does it
- definitely room for improvement performance wise. 
  there is a lot going on when the screen repaints wrt mutating global state
- also, there should probably be less global state
- what is that annoying text that appears on the command-line
  when you start up? can't tell by looking at anyone else's code
